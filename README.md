# bonc

A compiler for the Bon programming language.

## About 

### Note: This project is extremely WIP, like no executables being produced WIP

Bon is a work in progress statically typed, compiled programming language with (WIP) backends for x86 and RISC-V.

## Building

The Bon compiler uses ``meson`` for its build system, so the build tool ``ninja`` is required as well.

``mkdir build``

``meson setup build``

``cd build``

``ninja``

## Usage

``bon -h`` will give you usage information.

## Language

``docs/language.md`` is your friend.
