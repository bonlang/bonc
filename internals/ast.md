# The BCC2 AST

The internal AST is the first intermediate representation generated by the compiler and is built by the parser.  The parser emits an spotty AST with symbols unresolved and with expressions unannotated by types.  It also emits a symbol table with all information on types that can be gleaned during parsing. This includes types of annotated variable declarations and mutability.
